# Discord Identity

This repo serves to allow me to publically state the association between my Discord account and my GitHub account. This README claims my Discord username, and my Discord profile links to this README claiming my GitHub identity.

I am `@zicklag` on Discord, originally `@Zicklag#0963`.
